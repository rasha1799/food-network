            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>We love the things we love for what they are.In three words I can
                sum
                up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the
                heart's
                affections, and the truth of imagination.Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles
                is
                to
                school an intelligence and make it a soul? </p>

            <h2>My Recipies</h2>
            <p>Not everybody loves cooking, but once in a blue moon, we always get the urge to jump into the kitchen and
                whip up something delicious. However, it is hard to keep your culinary game fresh if you lack new ideas
                and always prepare the same old dish that you inherited from your mum.</p>

                    proportions of garlic and red chillies and ground it to a coarse paste.</p>

            <p>
                The Mediterranean diet is inspired by the eating patterns of countries like Italy, Spain, and Greece.

                A well-rounded Mediterranean diet should include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts,
                seeds, proteins, and healthy fats.</p>
            <h4>Plant-based diet</h4>
            <p>Plant-based diets encourage you to eat foods from plants, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds,
                oils, and legumes.</p>
